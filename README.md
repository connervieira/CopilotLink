# Copilot Link

A platform that allows various sensors and output devices in a car to communicate with eachother.

**Note:** Copilot Link is still in very early development, and everything is subject to change. At the moment, Copilot Link serves more as a proof of concept.


## Description

Modern cars are extremely complicated machine with thousands of connections and plenty of computers constantly processing information. For those who want to tamper a bit with their car, or even just want to monitor it, this can be both a good thing and a bad thing. The great news is that your car comes with hundreds of sensors all connected to a single computer. The bad news is that any sensors, outputs, and other devices you install yourself will be completely disconnected from the rest of your car. This is where Copilot Link comes in.

Copilot Link serves as a single platform to connect various devices in your car together using inexpensive hardware. Whether you just want the current time to be read out over your car's sound system, or you want to connect your car's OBD II port to a lighting system, Copilot tries to make the job as easy as possible.


## Features

### Open

Copilot Link is completely open and freely modifiable. Anyone who wants to add support for their custom set up is free to do so.

### Privacy

Copilot is completely privacy respecting and has absolutely no analytics built in.

### Offline

Copilot itself can run completely offline, meaning you aren't tethered to anywhere in specific. If your car can go somewhere, Copilot can come with it.

### Inexpensive

Copilot is designed to be used with inexpensive, generic parts. This allows you to connect plenty of sensors and output devices without having to spend hundreds of dollars.
